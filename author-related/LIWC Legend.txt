                   *Notes: “Words/Entries in category” refers to the number of different words and/or entries that make up the variable category. For function words, two numbers 
                   are included: number of different key words in the category and the total number of entries. For example, there are only about 8 primary negation words (e.g., 
                   wasn’t, isn’t) which are parts of 247 different entries (e.g., “wasn’t happy”). All alphas were computed on a sample of 15,000 texts from the Test Kitchen corpus 
                   (see Table 1). For the purpose of “translating” LIWC category internal consistencies with relation to what one might expect to see in other assessment methods, 
                   such as self-report questionnaires, we recommend that readers focus primarily on the Kuder–Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) values.
